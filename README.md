## 🧠 What is Minimax?

Imagine Minimax as a **little baby** playing Tic Tac Toe. But this baby is very smart. 

### 🍬 "I want the most sweets (points)!"
Minimax is like a greedy baby who wants to win every game. It looks at the board and thinks:
> *“If I make this move, how many sweets (points) can I get?”*

###  "But the other baby wants to stop me!"
The other player is also a clever baby. They want to win or at least block me from winning. So our baby Minimax doesn’t just pick the easiest-looking move. It pretends the opponent is smart too.

###  "I’ll try everything!"
Minimax goes into a **fantasy world**:
* *“What if I put my X here? What will the other baby do next?”*
* *“What if I put my X there instead? What happens?”*
It plays all possible games in its head, even the ones far in the future.



###  "Hmm… what’s best for me?"
Once it imagines all possible futures, it **scores** each ending:
* **+1** if it wins — *baby Minimax gains sweets!*
* **0** if it’s a draw — *baby Minimax doesn't lose or gain sweets.*
* **-1** if it loses — *sweets get taken from baby Minimax.*

###  "I can’t lose!"
Then it picks the move that gives the **best score**, knowing the other baby will try to ruin it. Because it thinks ahead about every possible move, this baby is **unbeatable**. 

Even if the other player is tricky, Minimax will **Never** make a mistake.
